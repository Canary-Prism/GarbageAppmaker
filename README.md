# GarbageAppMaker
So i am lazy and hate manual finger labour...

### this is one of the more complicate apps i've made, so [here](https://github.com/Canary-Prism/GarbageAppmaker/blob/main/Tutorial.md) is a tutorial/guide

### [Download](https://github.com/Canary-Prism/GarbageAppMaker/releases/)

I'm assuming you know how to use GitHub. If not then here:

### Download Steps

1. Click above link
2. Find latest release
3. Find "Assets" Section
4. Click the "GarbageAppMaker.y.z.jar" file

### Notice

This program uses Java, you should download and install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you haven't already to run this

#### [Here's a handy link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

(yes ik it should only need jre if it's compiled but idk how i managed to screw up my code so much that you still need jdk but here we are. If you manage to get this working with jre only plz tell me how and you will have earned the right to call me moron 20 times)
